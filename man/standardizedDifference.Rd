  Standardized Difference
}\name{standardizedDifference}\alias{standardizedDifference}\description{
  Standardize difference to assess imbalance in a covariates between treated and control subjects
}\usage{
  # Continuous variable
  standardizedDifference(mean.treatment, mean.control, sd.treatment, sd.control)
  # Dichotomous variable
  standardizedDifference(prop.treatment, prop.control)
}\arguments{
  \item{mean.treatment}{
    Sample mean of X in treated subject. 
}
  \item{mean.control}{
    Sample mean of X in control subject.
}
    \item{sd.treatment}{
    Sample standard deviation of X in treated subject.
}
    \item{sd.control}{
        Sample standard deviation of X in control subject.
}
    \item{prop.treatment}{
        Sample prevalence of the variable deviation of X in treated subject.
}
    \item{prop.control}{
    Sample prevalence of the variable deviation of X in treated subject.
}
}\details{
  One must choose to calculate the standardize difference of either a continuous or dichotomous variable. 
  For continuous variable, one must fill in the parameters :\code{mean.treatment}, \code{mean.control}, \code{sd.treatment} and \code{sd.control}. 
  For dichotomous variable, on must fill in the parameters : \code{prop.treatment} and \code{prop.control}. 
  You should not mix both sets of parametersand only use the one you want to work with.
